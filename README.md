# Credit Risk Modelling – PD & Expected Loss Framework

## Project Overview
This project implements an end-to-end **Credit Risk Analytics framework**
to estimate borrower default risk and portfolio-level credit losses.

The framework is designed to mirror real-world retail banking
credit risk practices.

---

## Objectives
- Build a Probability of Default (PD) model using Logistic Regression
- Segment borrowers into PD-based risk bands
- Estimate Expected Loss (EL) using PD × LGD × EAD
- Translate model outputs into business and credit policy insights

---

## Dataset
- German Credit Risk Dataset
- Borrower demographic, financial, and behavioral attributes

---

## Methodology
1. **Data Understanding & Cleaning**
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
3. **Feature Engineering & Encoding**
4. **PD Model Development (Logistic Regression)**
5. **Risk Segmentation & Business Validation**
6. **Expected Loss (EL) Estimation**

---

## Key Results
- Test AUC ≈ **0.76**, indicating strong discriminatory power
- Clear monotonic increase in default rates across risk bands
- High-risk borrowers contribute a disproportionate share of Expected Loss
- Model outputs are interpretable and business-aligned
